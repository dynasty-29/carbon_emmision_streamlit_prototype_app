Simple carbon emission app to help determine  per capita CO2 emission per country

# Per capitta CO2 Emission Predictor App using Streamlit

## By:dynasty


### Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to create a simple model app  that predicts the per capita co2 emission, and building a simple frontend application to make the model publicly available using Streamlit.

### Data Description
The data we will be using for this project is the Emissions by Country dataset which is publicly available via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022).

### Tools
Pandas for accessing the data, and preparing the it for modeling.

KNN for creating a regression model.

Streamlit for creating a frontend application
